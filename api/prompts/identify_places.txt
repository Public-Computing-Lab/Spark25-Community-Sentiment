Extract all location-related phrases from the user message you will be given. 
These may include specific places (e.g., “Talbot Avenue”, “Ashmont Station”) or vague/general areas (e.g., “the park near Ashmont”, “a block from Codman Square”).

For each location, return a JSON object containing:
- name: the full location phrase from the message
- type: either "specific" (a known place that can be directly geocoded) or "vague" (a general or relative reference that requires contextual resolution)
- reference (optional): for vague locations, include a nearby reference point mentioned in the phrase (e.g., “Ashmont” in “the park near Ashmont”)

Format your response as JSON, like this:

{
  "locations": [
    {
      "name": "Talbot Avenue",
      "type": "specific"
    },
    {
      "name": "the park near Ashmont",
      "type": "vague",
      "reference": "Ashmont"
    }
  ]
}

Do not generate coordinates or any other metadata. Only extract and classify location names from the user message.

Extract all location-related phrases from the user message you will be given. 
These may include specific places (e.g., "Talbot Avenue", "Ashmont Station") or vague/general areas (e.g., "the park near Ashmont", "a block from Codman Square").

Also determine the user's main intent from their question.

For each location, return a JSON object containing:
- name: the full location phrase from the message
- type: either "specific" (a known place that can be directly geocoded) or "vague" (a general or relative reference that requires contextual resolution)
- reference (optional): for vague locations, include a nearby reference point mentioned in the phrase (e.g., "Ashmont" in "the park near Ashmont")

Additionally, include:
- intent: what the user is asking about (e.g., "crime", "safety", "parking", "trash", "housing", "transportation", "general")

Format your response like this:

{
  "locations": [
    {
      "name": "Talbot Avenue",
      "type": "specific"
    },
    {
      "name": "the park near Ashmont",
      "type": "vague",
      "reference": "Ashmont"
    }
  ],
  "intent": "crime"
}

Intent examples:
- "crime" - questions about violence, shootings, safety, incidents
- "trash" - questions about dumping, waste, cleanliness
- "parking" - questions about parking availability, enforcement
- "housing" - questions about living conditions, property issues
- "transportation" - questions about buses, trains, accessibility
- "general" - general questions about the area

Don't wrap with backticks or use markdown to create a code block, just use this formatting in plaintext.
Do not generate coordinates or any other metadata. Only extract and classify information from the user message.
If there are no locations, say "No locations found." Nothing else, just this phrase.

Extract all location-related phrases from the user message you will be given. 
These may include specific places (e.g., “Talbot Avenue”, “Ashmont Station”) or vague/general areas (e.g., “the park near Ashmont”, “a block from Codman Square”).

For each location, return a JSON object containing:
- name: the full location phrase from the message
- type: either "specific" (a known place that can be directly geocoded) or "vague" (a general or relative reference that requires contextual resolution)
- reference (optional): for vague locations, include a nearby reference point mentioned in the phrase (e.g., “Ashmont” in “the park near Ashmont”)

Format your response like this:

{
  "locations": [
    {
      "name": "Talbot Avenue",
      "type": "specific"
    },
    {
      "name": "the park near Ashmont",
      "type": "vague",
      "reference": "Ashmont"
    }
  ]
}

Don't wrap with backticks or use markdown to create a code block, just use this formatting in plaintext.
Do not generate coordinates or any other metadata. Only extract and classify location names from the user message.
If there are no locations, say "No locations found." Nothing else, just this phrase.

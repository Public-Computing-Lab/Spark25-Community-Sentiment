# **Understanding Boston's "A Place to Thrive" Anti-Displacement Action Plan: What Talbot-Norfolk Triangle Residents Need to Know**

## **Overview: What is "A Place to Thrive"?**

"A Place to Thrive," released in March 2025, stands as Boston's inaugural citywide Anti-Displacement Action Plan.1 This comprehensive strategy outlines over forty initiatives slated for implementation over the next two years. Its primary objective is to address existing gaps in the City's ongoing efforts to protect residents, small businesses, and vital cultural institutions from the pressures of displacement.1 The plan is envisioned as a means to stabilize communities, allowing them to "deepen their roots" and flourish.1 It emerged from extensive community feedback and is designed to align with new city planning and strategic initiatives.1

The core ambitions of "A Place to Thrive" are twofold:

* To **stabilize residents**, encompassing both renters and homeowners, enabling them to "anchor and flourish" in their neighborhoods while also creating an environment that is welcoming to new neighbors.1  
* To **stabilize neighborhood commercial and creative enterprises**, thereby preserving their diversity and vibrancy, which are crucial to the character of Boston's communities.1

This plan serves as a "roadmap" for the City of Boston's anti-displacement work for the coming two years.1 It is important to understand that "A Place to Thrive" builds upon an existing foundation of over 80 tools and programs the City already employs to combat displacement.1 The development of this plan, which began in 2024 with the support of the Planning Advisory Council and a cross-departmental team, involved understanding community concerns, assessing current efforts, identifying key gaps, and developing new protections.1 The explicit aim to "fill gaps" in the City's approach signals an acknowledgment of past limitations and a commitment to a more robust and coordinated strategy moving forward.1

While the plan references over 40 initiatives, access to the complete, detailed report was not available through the provided materials.3 Consequently, this summary draws upon information from the main plan webpage, associated news releases, and related City documents. It is noteworthy that executive summaries of the plan are available in Boston's most commonly spoken languages, including Haitian Creole, Spanish, and Vietnamese, which may be of particular interest to the diverse population of Dorchester. These summaries can be requested by emailing antidisplacementplan@boston.gov.1

## **Why This Plan Matters for Dorchester and the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle**

The city-wide scope of "A Place to Thrive" holds particular significance for neighborhoods like Dorchester, including the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle (TNT), where the pressures of displacement are often acutely felt. The plan itself recognizes that displacement is not a monolithic issue but manifests in several distinct forms, each requiring tailored responses. These include:

* **Direct displacement:** This occurs when households are compelled to move from their homes due to circumstances such as non-renewal of a lease, eviction, foreclosure, demolition or substantial renovation of their building, or physical conditions that render a home uninhabitable, including climate-related disasters.1  
* **Economic displacement:** This refers to situations where households, businesses, or cultural organizations are forced to relocate because of escalating housing costs, rising property taxes, or shifts in the local retail environment that make continued operation or residency financially untenable.1  
* **Cultural displacement:** This more intangible form of displacement happens when changes in the nature of services and goods available in an area lead existing residents to feel a sense of dislocation, detachment from their community, or that the neighborhood no longer reflects or serves them.1

Recognizing these varied pressures is crucial because it allows for a more holistic understanding of the challenges TNT residents might face, from rising rents and development pressures to changes in local businesses that alter the community's fabric. The plan's acknowledgment of these multifaceted issues suggests an intent to develop more comprehensive solutions.

Furthermore, the City is actively piloting new methods of community engagement as part of this work. A tangible example for Dorchester residents is the "Shaping the Future: Codman Square Against Displacement" workshop, scheduled for June 2025\. Such events are designed to foster more meaningful conversations about displacement, educate residents about existing strategies and resources, and gather input to strengthen the City's anti-displacement efforts.5 This direct engagement in Dorchester underscores the plan's local relevance.

The development of "A Place to Thrive" incorporated community feedback from its inception.1 Importantly, this is not a static document; there are ongoing mechanisms for residents to provide input, including an online feedback form, email, and participation in workshops.2 The final version of the plan, incorporating this feedback, is anticipated in Summer 2025\.1 This iterative process signifies an opportunity for TNT residents to continue shaping anti-displacement strategies, particularly by engaging with local events and feedback channels. It suggests that the plan can evolve to better meet the specific needs and visions of communities like the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle.

## **Key City-Wide Strategies to Combat Displacement: The Four Pillars**

The City of Boston's anti-displacement efforts, as outlined in "A Place to Thrive," are structured around four central tenets: **Protect, Preserve, Produce, and Prosper**.2 This framework provides a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to tackling the complex issue of displacement from various angles, aiming to create stability for residents, businesses, and cultural institutions.

### **The "Protect" Pillar: Initiatives to Keep Residents and Businesses in Their Homes and Spaces**

The "Protect" pillar is fundamentally about safeguarding vulnerable populations—renters, lower-income homeowners, small businesses, and cultural community anchors—from the forces of displacement.2 These initiatives are designed to provide immediate defenses and establish clearer rights and processes.

A cornerstone of this pillar is the **Proposed Expansion of the City's Condominium Conversion Ordinance**. Currently, this ordinance offers protections to tenants in buildings with four or more units undergoing conversion to condominiums. The new proposal seeks to expand these protections to tenants in buildings with two or more units.2 This change is significant because it aims to ensure that a larger majority of tenants facing displacement due to condo conversions receive reasonable notice, freedom from undue disruption during the process, financial assistance for relocation, and, crucially, the opportunity to purchase their units.2 It is estimated that this expansion could affect 70% more rental units across the city.2 For Dorchester, and specifically the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle, where a considerable portion of the housing stock consists of two- and three-family homes, this expansion could offer vital new protections to many residents in smaller buildings that were previously not covered by the ordinance.8 The effectiveness of such an ordinance, however, relies not just on the legal rights it confers, such as notice periods or the option to purchase, but also on the practical ability of tenants to exercise these rights. This often necessitates access to financial resources, potentially through programs like the Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program (discussed under the "Produce" pillar), and legal support, which could be bolstered by the Eviction Prevention Action Plan.

Another key initiative under "Protect" is the **New Direct Displacement Disclosure**, which will be integrated into the Article 80 development review process.2 This new requirement mandates that developers whose projects are subject to Article 80 review must disclose any potential direct displacement of commercial, cultural, or residential tenants that their project might cause. Beyond disclosure, developers will be required to work with these potentially displaced tenants on a relocation plan.2 This measure represents a shift towards more proactive protection. Instead of addressing displacement only after it occurs or is imminent, this disclosure compels developers to consider and plan for displacement impacts from the early stages of a project. For a neighborhood like TNT, which may see ongoing development interest, this proactive element could be instrumental in shaping new projects to be more inclusive and to mitigate negative consequences for existing residents and businesses from the outset. The modernization of Article 80 itself is an ongoing city effort.1

Finally, the plan includes the development of an **Eviction Prevention Action Plan**. This initiative involves creating an updated, comprehensive strategy to lower eviction rates and enhance housing stability for Boston residents.2 There is an indication that this plan may be tied to Right to Counsel legislation, which would provide legal representation for tenants facing eviction.2 The Mayor's Office of Housing (MOH) FY26 budget further supports this by allocating resources for flexible financial assistance, mediation services, legal aid, and case management for renters at risk.11 This directly confronts the critical issue of housing security, a primary concern for many residents in Dorchester and TNT. Access to legal counsel and timely financial assistance can be pivotal in preventing homelessness and stabilizing households.

### **The "Preserve" Pillar: Initiatives to Maintain Affordability and Community Assets**

The "Preserve" pillar focuses on maintaining the existing stock of affordable housing and safeguarding community spaces and commercial assets that contribute to neighborhood character and stability.2

A significant new initiative under this pillar is the **Commercial Acquisition Assistance Program (CAAP)**. This program is designed to stabilize neighborhood commercial districts by supporting property ownership for small business owners. It will offer an expanded suite of financial tools to help local entrepreneurs purchase their properties.2 The City has already begun the process of establishing this program by seeking a Program Administrator and Advisor for CAAP.12 For Dorchester and TNT, CAAP offers a promising avenue to help local businesses, which are often the heart of the neighborhood, providing essential services, local employment, and contributing to the area's unique identity. By enabling these businesses to own their spaces, CAAP can protect them from displacement pressures like escalating commercial rents or building sales. This is not merely an economic preservation strategy; it is also a means of cultural preservation. Small businesses in neighborhoods like TNT frequently serve as cultural anchors, offering specific goods, services, and informal community gathering spaces. Helping these businesses acquire property, therefore, indirectly supports the preservation of the neighborhood's cultural fabric, addressing the type of "cultural displacement" identified by the plan.1

Complementing new programs, the City will continue to leverage and expand existing tools like the **Acquisition Opportunity Program (AOP)**. While AOP is already in place, the FY26 goals for the Mayor's Office of Housing include funding the acquisition of an additional 100 units through AOP, with the aim of preserving their affordability in perpetuity throughout Boston.11 This builds on successes like the 394 rental units whose tenancies and affordability were preserved in FY25 through AOP-funded acquisitions.11 For communities like TNT, AOP could be strategically employed to acquire existing multi-family buildings at risk of market-rate conversion. These properties could then be transitioned into permanently affordable housing, preventing the displacement of current tenants and securing these units for future lower- and moderate-income households. However, while acquiring units through AOP is a positive step, the scale of housing need in Boston and in neighborhoods like Dorchester facing intense market pressures is considerable. The ultimate effectiveness of preservation strategies like AOP will hinge on consistent, substantial funding and the agility to act swiftly when suitable properties become available. These programs are vital components of the solution but may not be able to save every at-risk unit or business without broader market interventions or significantly scaled-up resources.

### **The "Produce" Pillar: Initiatives to Create More Affordable Housing and Spaces**

The "Produce" pillar is centered on actively increasing the supply of affordable housing options and creating more commercial and cultural spaces within the city.2 This involves both new construction and innovative approaches to utilizing existing assets.

A flagship initiative under this pillar is the **Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program**. This new program is designed to provide financial assistance and dedicated support to help multiple low- and moderate-income households pool their financial resources to collectively purchase a two- or three-family home.2 This initiative is particularly highlighted as a potential pathway to building intergenerational wealth, especially for Boston's BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities.2 The program's relevance to Dorchester and the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle is exceptionally high, given that a significant portion of the housing stock in these areas consists of two- and three-family dwellings.8 The Co-Purchasing Program could empower current TNT residents, who might otherwise be priced out of the homeownership market, to become homeowners and remain rooted in their community. These new homeowners could also function as owner-occupants, potentially offering the remaining units in their properties as affordable rental options. This model is particularly innovative as it moves beyond the traditional single-family homeownership paradigm and acknowledges the housing realities and preferences of many Bostonians, including multi-generational households or those interested in cooperative living arrangements.

Another key production strategy is the **Expansion of the City's successful Office to Residential Conversion Program**. This program, which incentivizes the conversion of underutilized or vacant office buildings into residential units, will now be expanded to include the creation of student housing and employer-sponsored workforce housing.2 The State government is also providing financial support for such conversions.14 Boston's program has already demonstrated considerable traction, with a growing pipeline of projects.14 While many of these large-scale office conversions are likely to occur in downtown areas, the underlying principle of creatively adapting existing structures for housing could inspire similar adaptive reuse projects in other parts of the city, including Dorchester, should suitable properties be identified. More broadly, any increase in the overall housing supply, particularly units dedicated to workforce or affordable housing, can help alleviate market pressures city-wide, which may indirectly benefit Dorchester by reducing competition for existing housing stock.

The "Produce" pillar also includes the **Launch of the City's first comprehensive Civic and Cultural Infrastructure Planning Framework**. The goal of this framework is to develop a coherent, city-wide strategy for delivering more accessible and sustainable cultural spaces throughout Boston.2 For Dorchester and TNT, this could translate into the creation of new, or the preservation of existing, spaces dedicated to arts, community events, heritage activities, and other forms of cultural expression, thereby actively combating cultural displacement and enriching community life.

Finally, a fundamental aspect of production is the ongoing **Permitting of New Income-Restricted Units**. The Mayor's Office of Housing has set an FY26 goal to permit 1,000 new income-restricted units across the city, comprising 700 rental units and 300 homeownership opportunities.11 This follows the permitting of 783 such units in FY25.11 The MOH budget also emphasizes the creation of permanent supportive housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness.11 Any new affordable units created in Dorchester, or made accessible to Dorchester residents through fair housing practices, would directly address the pressing need for more affordable housing options in the neighborhood. While increasing housing production is critical, residents in neighborhoods like TNT often voice concerns about how new development integrates with the existing neighborhood fabric in terms of density, design, and the mix of affordability. The success of the "Produce" pillar in Dorchester will therefore depend not only on the quantity of units created but also on how well these new projects align with established community visions and the character of the neighborhood. Mechanisms such as the ongoing Article 80 modernization process 1 and the new Direct Displacement Disclosure requirement 2 are intended to provide avenues for addressing these concerns, but active community participation and vigilance will be essential to ensure development is both robust and respectful.

### **The "Prosper" Pillar: Initiatives to Build Community Wealth and Stability**

The "Prosper" pillar represents the overarching ambition of the Anti-Displacement Action Plan: to create an environment where all Bostonians have the opportunity to build wealth, achieve financial stability, and enhance their overall well-being.2 This pillar is less about a distinct set of new, standalone programs and more about the cumulative, positive impact of initiatives across the "Protect," "Preserve," and "Produce" tenets, complemented by broader economic development efforts.

Several initiatives already discussed contribute directly to the goals of the "Prosper" pillar. For instance, the **Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program** 2 is explicitly framed as a tool for wealth creation through homeownership, particularly for historically disadvantaged communities. Similarly, the **Commercial Acquisition Assistance Program (CAAP)** 2 aims to foster business ownership and economic self-sufficiency for local entrepreneurs. These programs connect anti-displacement efforts directly to broader goals of racial and economic justice, a connection that is particularly resonant for the diverse population of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle.

Other city initiatives also align with the "Prosper" tenet. The **Boston Energy Saver Program**, for example, aims to leverage Mass Save resources to help both residents and small businesses lower their energy costs through energy efficiency upgrades and new HVAC systems.11 Reduced utility expenses can significantly improve household financial stability and decrease operating costs for small businesses, freeing up resources that can be invested elsewhere. Furthermore, broader city efforts, such as the Mayor's announcement of a new **Business Recruitment Office** to fill commercial vacancies and revitalize business districts 16, contribute to job creation and economic vitality, which are foundational to community prosperity.

For residents of TNT, "prospering" encompasses more than just secure housing; it includes access to economic opportunities, safe and healthy environments, and the availability of amenities and services that contribute to a high quality of life. The success of the "Prosper" pillar will ultimately be measured by tangible improvements in these broader areas, reflecting not just a reduction in displacement statistics but an enhancement in the overall economic mobility and well-being of the community.

### **Table 1: Overview of Key Anti-Displacement Initiatives**

To provide a clear summary, the following table outlines some of the key new or expanded initiatives within the "A Place to Thrive" plan, their primary goals, the strategic pillar they fall under, and their potential relevance for residents of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle.

| Initiative Name | Primary Goal | Key Tenet | Specific Relevance/Potential Benefit for TNT Residents (Housing, Safety, Transport, Business) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Expanded Condo Conversion Ordinance | Protect tenants in smaller buildings (2+ units) during condo conversions | Protect | **Housing:** Increased notice, relocation aid, right of first refusal for tenants in 2-3 family homes common in TNT. |

| Office to Residential Conversion Expansion | Convert underused offices to housing (incl. student/workforce) | Produce | **Housing:** Indirectly benefits TNT by increasing overall city housing supply, potentially easing pressure. |
| Civic and Cultural Infrastructure Plan | Strategize for more cultural space in Boston | Produce | **Cultural:** Potential for new or preserved community/arts spaces in or near TNT. |
| Boston Energy Saver Program | Help residents/small businesses lower energy costs | Prosper (contributes) | **Housing/Business:** Reduced utility bills for TNT households and businesses, increasing financial stability. |

## **Spotlight on Dorchester: How the Plan Impacts Our Neighborhood**

While "A Place to Thrive" is a city-wide strategy, many of its components have direct and significant implications for Dorchester and its residents, including those in the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle. The plan seeks to provide a layered approach to addressing neighborhood-specific challenges related to housing, public safety, transportation, and local economic vitality.

### **Housing Initiatives and Their Relevance to Dorchester Residents**

Dorchester's diverse housing stock, which includes a large number of two- and three-family homes, stands to benefit directly from several key initiatives. The **Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program** 2 is particularly well-suited to this context, offering a viable path to homeownership for residents who might pool resources with family or friends. Similarly, the **expanded Condominium Conversion Ordinance** 2 will extend crucial protections to tenants in these smaller multi-family buildings, which are prevalent throughout Dorchester.

The Mayor's Office of Housing's FY26 goals to permit 1,000 new income-restricted units (700 rental, 300 homeownership) 11 are also vital. Dorchester could see some of these new affordable homes built within its boundaries, or its residents could access new units elsewhere in the city, helping to alleviate local housing pressures. This aligns with long-standing city goals to mitigate the impacts of gentrification, as highlighted in previous planning documents like Boston 2030, which emphasized targeted homebuyer assistance and strategic acquisitions.17 The current plan's "Protect" and "Preserve" initiatives, such as the Acquisition Opportunity Program (AOP) 11, represent contemporary efforts to achieve these aims.

A critical tool for understanding and addressing local housing vulnerabilities is the City's new **Residential Displacement Risk Map**.1 This interactive map allows residents and community organizations in Dorchester to assess displacement risk levels at the Census Block Group level. This data-driven resource can be more than just informational; it can empower Dorchester communities. By identifying specific areas of vulnerability, residents and local groups can advocate more effectively for targeted interventions, direct city resources to where they are most needed, and track progress in addressing high-risk zones. This facilitates a shift from anecdotal concerns to data-backed advocacy, strengthening the community's voice in planning and policy discussions.

The plan's approach to housing in Dorchester is not a single solution but rather a combination of strategies: protecting existing tenants from unfair displacement, preserving the affordability of current housing stock, and producing new affordable homes. Understanding this multi-pronged strategy is key for Dorchester residents to see how these varied initiatives can collectively contribute to greater housing stability, even if no single program can solve all challenges alone.

### **Public Safety Measures and Connections to the Anti-Displacement Plan**

While "A Place to Thrive" is not primarily a public safety plan, its overarching goal of stabilizing communities 1 has inherent connections to public safety. Stable, cohesive communities, where residents feel secure in their homes and connected to their neighbors, are often safer communities. Displacement, conversely, can disrupt social networks, reduce informal "eyes on the street," and sometimes lead to vacant properties that can attract nuisance activities, thereby undermining community stability and, indirectly, safety. Therefore, every successful effort to keep a Dorchester family in their home or a local business operational through the plan's initiatives contributes to the social fabric that underpins public safety.

Broader city efforts also contribute to safety. During her State of the City address, Mayor Michelle Wu noted that gun violence in Boston had reached a 10-year low, attributing this to the work of the Boston Police Department.16 Specific neighborhood-level initiatives also play a role. For example, the **Neighborhood Slow Streets program**, which was previously piloted in the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle, directly improves pedestrian safety and calms traffic through physical changes to streets like speed humps.18 Such improvements to the quality of public spaces not only enhance safety but can also deepen residents' attachment to their neighborhood, fostering a greater sense of community investment and well-being, which itself can be a subtle anti-displacement effect. Older city strategies also pointed to the importance of resolving problem properties as a measure to improve neighborhood safety and stability.17

### **Transportation Developments Supporting Stability in Dorchester**

Access to reliable and affordable transportation is a critical factor in neighborhood stability, connecting residents to jobs, education, healthcare, and other essential services. The Anti-Displacement Action Plan and related city efforts recognize the importance of linking housing with transportation infrastructure.

A clear example of this linkage in Dorchester is the **New England Heritage Homes development** in Codman Square, located near the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle. This project, which created 16 mixed-income homes, is explicitly described as a "transit-oriented development" due to its proximity to the Talbot Avenue MBTA station on the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line.18 This development is part of a larger community effort to target development opportunities near existing and planned stops on the Fairmount Line, a key transit corridor serving Dorchester.

The focus on transit-oriented development (TOD) along the Fairmount Line corridor presents both opportunities and challenges. Improved transit access can significantly enhance residents' quality of life and connectivity. However, such improvements can also lead to increased property values and attract higher-income residents, potentially exacerbating displacement pressures if not managed carefully. The success of TOD in Dorchester as an anti-displacement strategy will therefore depend critically on embedding robust affordability protections within these new developments and in the surrounding areas, ensuring that existing residents can benefit from, rather than be displaced by, these investments.

Beyond major transit lines, the daily transportation needs of Dorchester residents also involve "last mile" connectivity – safely and easily getting from home to transit stations, local shops, schools, and community services. Initiatives like the Neighborhood Slow Streets program 18, by improving walkability and bikeability, address this crucial aspect of intra-neighborhood transportation. These improvements contribute to overall quality of life and can reduce reliance on cars, which can be a significant household expense, thereby supporting financial stability.

### **Support for Dorchester's Small Businesses and Cultural Institutions**

The vitality of Dorchester's neighborhoods is inextricably linked to the health of its small businesses and cultural institutions. "A Place to Thrive" includes several measures aimed at supporting these crucial community assets. The plan's overarching goal to "stabilize neighborhood commercial and creative enterprises, enabling their diversity and vibrancy" 1 is directly applicable to Dorchester.

The new **Commercial Acquisition Assistance Program (CAAP)** 2 stands out as a major tool that could directly benefit Dorchester's many local businesses. By providing financial assistance for property ownership, CAAP can help these businesses secure their locations, protect themselves from rent hikes, and continue to serve the community. Supporting these small businesses is not merely about individual enterprises; it is about preserving Dorchester's local economic ecosystem. These businesses provide local jobs, offer culturally relevant goods and services, and contribute significantly to the unique identity and character of the neighborhood. Their displacement can have ripple effects, impacting residents' access to amenities and local employment opportunities.

The **New Direct Displacement Disclosure** requirement under Article 80 also extends to commercial and cultural tenants.2 This means that if a new development project has the potential to displace a local Dorchester shop or cultural organization, the developer must disclose this impact and work with the affected entity on a relocation plan.

Furthermore, the **Civic and Cultural Infrastructure Planning Framework** 2 aims to develop a strategy for delivering more cultural space throughout Boston. For Dorchester, with its rich cultural diversity, this could lead to the creation of new, or the preservation of existing, accessible and affordable spaces for arts, community gatherings, and heritage preservation. Such spaces are vital infrastructure for social cohesion and community resilience, acting as important anchors against the forces of cultural displacement.1

## **Focus on Talbot-Norfolk Triangle (TNT): Specific Connections and Local Actions**

The Talbot-Norfolk Triangle (TNT) neighborhood in Dorchester has a history of targeted community development efforts and active local organizations, providing a strong foundation for the implementation of the new city-wide Anti-Displacement Action Plan.

### **Review of Past and Existing Initiatives Directly Impacting TNT**

For years, the Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation (CSNDC) has identified the Talbot-Norfolk-Triangle and the Four Corners area as key focus zones for its work. CSNDC's strategic goals have included minimizing the impacts of gentrification and resident displacement through a combination of organizing, advocacy, economic development, and real estate development strategies.19 This work has often been carried out in close partnership with local groups such as the Talbot Norfolk Triangle Neighborhood Association and The Boston Project Ministries (TBPM).19 This existing network of collaboration and local expertise represents a significant asset; the City's new plan does not enter a vacuum but can leverage these established relationships and the deep community knowledge these organizations possess.

A concrete example of successful collaboration is the **New England Heritage Homes development**. This $7 million project, completed in 2019, created 16 mixed-income homes for sale to first-time, moderate-income homeowners in Codman Square, proximate to TNT. It was a joint effort involving CSNDC and TNT Neighbors United, strategically located near the Talbot Ave MBTA station on the Fairmount Line.18 This project specifically targeted development opportunities near this transit corridor, aligning with goals to create transit-oriented communities.

Furthermore, the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was distinguished as one of two pilot zones for the City's **Neighborhood Slow Streets program** in 2017\. This initiative involved reducing the local speed limit to 20 mph and installing physical traffic calming measures, such as speed humps, to enhance pedestrian safety and improve the neighborhood's living environment.18 TNT's role as a pilot zone for such an innovative urban solution suggests that the area has been, and can continue to be, a receptive ground for testing and implementing new approaches to community improvement. This history could position TNT as a strong candidate for piloting or intensively focusing some of the new initiatives emerging from "A Place to Thrive."

### **How City-Wide Anti-Displacement Initiatives Specifically Address TNT's Needs and Opportunities**

The broad strategies outlined in "A Place to Thrive" can be tailored to address the specific needs and leverage the unique opportunities within the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle.

In **housing**, the initiatives hold particular promise for TNT. The **Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program** 2 is highly relevant given the prevalence of two- and three-family homes in TNT, offering a tangible pathway for current residents to achieve homeownership and remain in their community. The **expanded Condominium Conversion Ordinance** 2 will provide crucial new protections for tenants residing in these smaller multi-family buildings, which form a significant part of TNT's housing fabric. Additionally, the City's **Acquisition Opportunity Program (AOP)** 11 could be strategically deployed in TNT to acquire existing rental properties at risk of market-rate conversion, thereby preserving them as long-term affordable housing for current and future residents. The success of applying these city-wide tools effectively in TNT will necessitate a nuanced understanding of the micro-local context. For example, identifying specific properties where the Co-Purchasing Program could empower current tenants, or pinpointing key local businesses that could benefit most from CAAP, will require close collaboration between City agencies and TNT's active community organizations.

Regarding **public safety and transportation**, the legacy of the Neighborhood Slow Streets program 18 in TNT provides a foundation to build upon. Further investments in traffic calming, pedestrian infrastructure, or bicycle amenities could continue to enhance safety, connectivity, and overall livability within the neighborhood. As development interest continues, particularly around the Talbot Avenue MBTA station—a transit corridor that presents both opportunities for improved services and risks of heightened displacement if not managed carefully—it will be critical to ensure that any new projects include robust affordability components and tangible community benefits. The new plan's tools must be proactively applied along this corridor to foster equitable development that benefits, rather than displaces, existing TNT residents.

For **small businesses and cultural life** in and serving TNT, the **Commercial Acquisition Assistance Program (CAAP)** 2 offers a new resource to help local entrepreneurs secure their physical spaces, fostering stability and continuity. The **Direct Displacement Disclosure** requirement 2 also provides a layer of protection should new development projects pose a threat to existing local TNT businesses or cherished community spaces.

## **Key Takeaways for TNT Residents and How to Get Involved**

Boston's "A Place to Thrive" Anti-Displacement Action Plan introduces a range of new and expanded tools designed to help stabilize communities like the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle. For TNT residents, understanding these potential benefits and knowing how to engage with the plan are crucial next steps.

### **Summary of Potential Benefits and Protections**

The plan offers several potential benefits and protections directly relevant to TNT residents. These include stronger safeguards for tenants in smaller multi-family buildings facing condominium conversions, increased transparency regarding potential displacement from new development projects, and new opportunities for low- and moderate-income households to achieve homeownership through programs like co-purchasing. Support for local small businesses to own their properties is another key opportunity. The overarching goal is to provide more comprehensive resources and a more coordinated City response to displacement pressures than has been available previously.

### **Accessing Resources: The Displacement Risk Map and Other Tools**

Several resources are available to help residents understand and navigate the plan:

* **Residential Displacement Risk Map:** This interactive online tool allows residents to view displacement risk levels for their specific Census Block Group.1 It can be explored on the City's website at boston.gov/anti-displacement.  
* **Program Information:** As specific initiatives like the Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program and the Commercial Acquisition Assistance Program (CAAP) are fully launched, detailed information, eligibility criteria, and application processes will likely become available through the Mayor's Office of Housing (MOH) and the Office of Economic Opportunity and Inclusion (OEOI). Residents should monitor official City announcements from these departments.  
* **Executive Summaries:** Executive summaries of "A Place to Thrive" are available in multiple languages, including English, Haitian Creole, Spanish, and Vietnamese. These can be found on the plan's webpage or requested via email from antidisplacementplan@boston.gov.1 Full translated content beyond the executive summary can also be requested through this email.

### **Community Engagement: Workshops, Feedback, and Staying Informed**

The City has emphasized its commitment to ongoing community engagement. Although the initial 45-day comment period following the plan's release in March 2025 may have passed 2, the intent for continued dialogue remains.

* **Feedback Channels:** Residents can generally submit comments or questions about the Anti-Displacement Action Plan using the online Feedback Form available on the plan's website or by emailing antidisplacementplan@boston.gov.1  
* **Community Workshops:** The City is hosting workshops, such as the "Shaping the Future: Codman Square Against Displacement" event in June 2025 5, to discuss displacement, share information about strategies, and gather community input. TNT residents are encouraged to look out for announcements of future workshops or meetings relevant to Dorchester.  
* **Related Planning Efforts:** Ongoing planning initiatives in nearby areas, such as Fields Corner 1, may also be relevant for Dorchester residents to monitor for broader neighborhood impacts and engagement opportunities.  
* **Plan Updates:** A summary of feedback received and the final version of the Anti-Displacement Action Plan are expected to be published in Summer 2025\.1

The release of "A Place to Thrive" and its initial feedback period mark important milestones, but they are just the beginning of a longer process. For TNT residents to fully benefit from the plan's initiatives, sustained community advocacy and engagement will be essential. This includes actively monitoring the implementation of specific programs, providing ongoing feedback to the City, working collaboratively with local community organizations like CSNDC or TNT Neighbors United to champion the neighborhood's unique needs, and holding the City accountable for achieving the plan's stated goals. The plan provides new tools, but proactive community action will be vital to wielding them effectively.

Accessing City programs and navigating bureaucratic processes can sometimes be challenging. While the plan offers resources like the Displacement Risk Map and contact emails, TNT residents may find valuable support from established local community development corporations and neighborhood associations. These groups can often act as crucial intermediaries, helping residents understand program eligibility, navigate application processes, and connect with the appropriate City departments, such as the Mayor's Office of Housing or the Office of Economic Opportunity and Inclusion.

## **Conclusions**

The City of Boston's "A Place to Thrive" Anti-Displacement Action Plan represents a significant and comprehensive effort to address the multifaceted challenges of displacement facing residents, small businesses, and cultural institutions across the city. For the residents of Dorchester's Talbot-Norfolk Triangle (TNT), this plan offers a range of new and expanded tools and strategies with the potential to enhance housing stability, support local economic vitality, and preserve the unique character of their community.

Key initiatives such as the expanded Condominium Conversion Ordinance, the Co-Purchasing Homebuyer Program, and the Commercial Acquisition Assistance Program are particularly relevant to the housing stock and commercial fabric of TNT and greater Dorchester. The plan's emphasis on a four-pillar approach—Protect, Preserve, Produce, and Prosper—signals a commitment to tackling displacement from multiple angles, from immediate tenant protections and preservation of affordable assets to the creation of new housing and opportunities for wealth building.

The introduction of tools like the Residential Displacement Risk Map and requirements for Direct Displacement Disclosure under Article 80 aim to bring greater transparency and data-informed decision-making to development and anti-displacement efforts. Furthermore, the City's stated commitment to community engagement, evidenced by workshops and feedback mechanisms, provides an avenue for TNT residents to continue shaping these initiatives.

However, the ultimate success of "A Place to Thrive" in benefiting the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle will depend on several factors. These include robust and sustained funding for the outlined programs, effective and accessible implementation by City agencies, and, crucially, the continued active engagement and advocacy of TNT residents and their local community organizations. The historical activism and collaborative spirit within TNT provide a strong foundation for this engagement.

Moving forward, it will be important for TNT residents to stay informed about program launches, utilize available resources, participate in community discussions, and work with local partners to ensure that the plan's initiatives are tailored and applied effectively to meet the specific needs and aspirations of their neighborhood. By doing so, the residents of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle can play a vital role in helping to realize the vision of "A Place to Thrive" within their own community.

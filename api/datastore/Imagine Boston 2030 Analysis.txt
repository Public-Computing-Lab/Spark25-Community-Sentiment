This constraint particularly influences the findings for specific neighborhood areas like the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle, as direct mentions within the overarching city-wide plan may be limited.

## **II. Overview of Imagine Boston 2030 Goals and Structure**

### **Overarching Vision**

"Imagine Boston 2030 is Boston's first citywide plan in 50 years".1 This comprehensive framework was "Shaped by more than 15,000 residents" and aims "to preserve and enhance Boston".1 A central theme is leveraging the city's growth to address contemporary challenges. The plan "sets a framework to seize this moment of opportunity to achieve Boston's goals of encouraging continued economic growth, becoming more affordable and equitable, and preparing for climate change".2 The overarching intent is to "guide growth to create new places to live and work, improve quality of life, and increase affordability".2

### **Core City-Wide Goals**

The "Imagine Boston 2030" plan articulates several core goals to direct its implementation and measure its success:

* "encourage affordability, reduce displacement, and improve quality of life." 1  
* "increase access to opportunity." 1  
* "drive inclusive economic growth." 1  
* "promote a healthy environment and prepare for climate change, and." 1  
* "invest in open space, arts and culture, transportation, and infrastructure." 1

### **Key Challenges Addressed**

The formulation of these goals was informed by an analysis of key opportunities and challenges facing the city. These include:

* "Productive economy"  
* "Growing population"  
* "Affordability"  
* "Inequality"  
* "Changing climate"  
* "Transformative technology." 2

### **Structure of the Plan's Actions**

"Imagine Boston 2030" organizes its strategies into distinct categories. It "identifies types of places for growth and enhancement," which are referred to as "Taking Action" areas.1 These represent physical locations where multiple initiatives converge to address specific opportunities and challenges. Complementing these spatial strategies are "Initiatives," defined as "Policies and investments that will address the goals" across ten thematic categories.2 This dual structure suggests a comprehensive approach, combining place-based interventions with overarching policy frameworks to ensure that urban growth is managed and directed towards achieving broad social, economic, and environmental objectives. The Fairmount Corridor serves as a notable example where these spatial and thematic strategies intersect.

### **Table: Major Imagine Boston 2030 Action Areas and Initiative Categories**

To provide a clear overview of the plan's main components, the following table summarizes the key "Taking Action" areas and "Initiative" categories. This structure aids in navigating the plan's diverse elements.

| Action Area / Initiative Category | Brief Description of Focus (from plan) |
| :---- | :---- |

## **III. "Taking Action" Areas**

The "Imagine Boston 2030" plan outlines five major "Taking Action" areas. These are "physical locations where initiatives come together to respond to key opportunities and challenges. They are the physical embodiment of Boston's boldest aspirations: a set of initiatives that, when implemented in the same location, will achieve multiple goals".1

### **A. ENHANCE NEIGHBORHOODS**

City-Wide Goal:  
The primary goal of this action area is to "Improve the public realm, strengthen neighborhood services and connectivity, and encourage contextually sensitive development to improve urban vitality and to affirm each neighborhood's distinct identity".2 This reflects that "Residents care about strengthening what we love about our neighborhoods".1 The emphasis on "contextually sensitive development" and affirming "each neighborhood's distinct identity" signifies an approach that values tailored solutions over uniform strategies, recognizing the diverse character of Boston's communities. For a varied area like Dorchester, this implies that enhancements would need to be specifically adapted to its unique characteristics and the needs articulated by its residents.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* The general city-wide objective to "enhance neighborhoods" is applicable across Boston, including Dorchester. Specific applications would be determined by local planning processes that are guided by this overarching city goal.  
* The "Generate Networks of Opportunity: Fairmount Corridor" initiative (detailed further below), which includes "coordinated investments in... neighborhood vibrancy" 2, has direct implications for enhancing those parts of Dorchester situated along the corridor.  
* Thematically, this action area is closely linked to improving the quality of life. Potential impacts include enhancing public safety through improved urban design, upgrading parks and open spaces, and bolstering community centers, should "neighborhood services" encompass such facilities.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this action area in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **B. ENCOURAGE A MIXED-USE CORE**

City-Wide Goal:  
This action area aims to "Continue to encourage dense, walkable, mixed-use development and public realm improvements to foster a core where more people live, work, and gather".2 The rationale is that "Boston's core is the anchor of the City's economy".1 While this initiative appears less directly relevant to specific residential neighborhoods outside the central business district, the economic vitality of the "mixed-use core" is presented as foundational to the city's overall prosperity. Investments in the core are thus viewed as beneficial to the entire city, including neighborhoods like Dorchester, through potential job creation and the generation of regional economic strength.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* The focus of this action area is primarily "Boston's core." Dorchester is not typically classified as part of this central mixed-use core.  
* Consequently, no direct projects or investments specifically within Dorchester are identified under this action area in the available plan summaries. However, improvements to the core can have indirect economic and transportation benefits for all neighborhoods.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this action area in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **C. EXPAND NEIGHBORHOODS**

City-Wide Goal:  
The goal is to "Provide significant new mixed-use housing and encourage job growth in transit-accessible areas at the edges of existing neighborhoods to reduce housing-price pressure, expand access to opportunity, and stitch together the physical fabric of the city".2 This strategy responds to input from residents who "identified areas between neighborhoods as places where Boston can grow".1 The approach of "expanding neighborhoods" into "transit-accessible areas" is a direct response to housing demand and seeks to leverage existing infrastructure investments. For areas within Dorchester that are well-served by transit, such as those along the Fairmount Line, this initiative could present opportunities for new housing and amenities, though careful management would be needed to ensure affordability and mitigate displacement.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* This action area holds significant relevance for Dorchester, especially in locations with good transit access, such as along the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line or the MBTA Red Line, which might be identified as appropriate for expansion or infill development.  
* The stated objectives to "reduce housing-price pressure" and "expand access to opportunity" directly address key challenges pertinent to many Dorchester residents.  
* The "Generate Networks of Opportunity: Fairmount Corridor" initiative, with its emphasis on transit-accessible areas, aligns closely with this goal. Any housing or job growth initiatives undertaken along the Dorchester segments of the Fairmount Corridor would serve as examples of the "Expand Neighborhoods" strategy in action.  
* Thematically, this action area directly impacts Housing (new developments, affordability), Economic Opportunity (job growth), and Transportation (development in transit-accessible areas).

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this action area in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **D. CREATE A WATERFRONT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS**

City-Wide Goal:  
The objective is to "Create a waterfront for all Bostonians that is climate-resilient and has the stewardship needed to thrive for coming generations".2 The plan emphasizes, "We must also create a resilient and inclusive waterfront for future generations".1 The dual focus on making the waterfront "climate-resilient" and "inclusive" is significant. For Dorchester's considerable coastline, this implies not only physical protection against climate change impacts but also a commitment to ensuring that any new developments or amenities benefit existing residents and enhance equitable access to waterfront areas. This approach acknowledges that waterfront planning should address historical inequities alongside climate adaptation.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Dorchester possesses a significant coastline along Dorchester Bay, making this initiative directly pertinent to the neighborhood.  
* Projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience (e.g., flood protection measures, development of green infrastructure) and improving public access along Dorchester's waterfront would fall under the purview of this action area.  
* Thematically, this action area connects to Parks and Open Spaces (through waterfront access), Transportation (facilitating access to the waterfront), and Public Safety (via climate resilience and flood protection).

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this action area in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan, as the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle is not a waterfront area.

### **E. GENERATE NETWORKS OF OPPORTUNITY: FAIRMOUNT CORRIDOR**

City-Wide Goal:  
This action area aims to "Expand access to opportunity and reduce disparities through coordinated investments in transportation, neighborhood vibrancy, and education".2 The plan explicitly states, "We want to expand access to opportunity and reduce disparities along the Fairmount Corridor".1 It notes that "The corridor is home to a diverse population. This includes a growing population of school-aged children and immigrant communities".1 The framing of the "Fairmount Corridor" initiative as an equity-focused endeavor ("reduce disparities," "expand access to opportunity") signals a targeted effort to address historical underinvestment and socio-economic challenges in the communities along this transit line. The success of this initiative is pivotal for achieving the plan's broader goals of inclusivity.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* The Fairmount Corridor traverses significant portions of Dorchester, rendering this initiative of paramount importance to the neighborhood.  
* A key component is that "Initiatives range from... improving connections, frequency and experience on the Fairmount/Indigo Line".2 This directly impacts transportation infrastructure and services within Dorchester.  
* The emphasis on "coordinated investments" implies a multi-faceted strategy to improve living conditions and opportunities for residents in this part of Dorchester.  
* Thematically, this is a cross-cutting initiative impacting Transportation (Fairmount Line enhancements), Economic Opportunity (reducing disparities, improving access to opportunity), Education (investment in education along the corridor), and potentially Housing (through "neighborhood vibrancy" and transit-oriented development potential) and Youth Engagement (given the mention of a growing population of school-aged children).

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this action area in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan. However, the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle is geographically situated along or in close proximity to the Fairmount Line, making the broader Fairmount Corridor initiatives highly relevant to the residents of TNT.

## **IV. "Initiatives" (Policies and Investments)**

Beyond the spatially focused "Taking Action" areas, "Imagine Boston 2030" outlines ten categories of "Initiatives." These are "Policies and investments that will address the goals" 2 of the plan. The overarching purpose of these initiatives is "to support Boston's dynamic economy and improve quality of life for residents by encouraging affordability, increasing access to opportunity, promoting a healthy environment and guiding investment in the public realm".2

### **A. HOUSING**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan states, "We will encourage responsible housing production. We'll work to increase affordable housing options and reduce displacement".1 It further calls for "developing and preserving affordable and middle-income housing and discusses the city's antidisplacement approach".4 A key strategy highlighted is that "The Taking Action section calls for transit-accessible, mixed-use housing as part of the Expand Neighborhoods goal".4 The corresponding plan, "Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030," reinforces this with the vision: "We're creating a city where all Bostonians can find a place to call home".1 The housing initiative is therefore intrinsically linked to the "Expand Neighborhoods" and "Fairmount Corridor" action areas. The success in creating affordable housing options, particularly in neighborhoods like Dorchester, will depend on the effective implementation of these broader spatial strategies alongside specific anti-displacement and affordability measures.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* The initiative to improve "connections, frequency and experience on the Fairmount/Indigo Line" 2 is expected to spur transit-oriented development, which includes housing, in areas of Dorchester served by the line.  
* The city-wide goals of increasing the supply of affordable housing and reducing resident displacement are highly relevant to Dorchester, a neighborhood experiencing significant housing pressures.  
* Policies and programs developed under this initiative would apply to both new housing development and the preservation of existing affordable housing in Dorchester.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **B. HEALTH & SAFETY**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan articulates a commitment: "We strive to address persistent health inequities. We'll do this by setting goals for improving health outcomes for all residents".1 The "Framework for Safe Neighborhoods and Innovative Partnerships" is listed as a corresponding plan, indicating that its goals are aligned with this initiative.1 The objective to "address persistent health inequities" implies a data-informed approach to target resources and interventions. For a community like Dorchester, this could translate into focusing on specific health challenges prevalent in the area and connecting them to urban planning solutions, such as improving access to healthy food options, creating safe recreational spaces, and reducing exposure to environmental hazards.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Efforts aimed at addressing health inequities would be particularly relevant to Dorchester, especially in areas where health disparities have been documented.  
* Investments in parks, open spaces, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure (which falls under the Transportation initiative), and community facilities can contribute positively to both the health and safety of Dorchester residents.  
* Initiatives pursued under the "Generate Networks of Opportunity: Fairmount Corridor" action area, such as those aimed at improving neighborhood vibrancy, could also yield positive health and safety impacts in the relevant sections of Dorchester.  
* This initiative encompasses thematic priorities such as Public Safety, Policing, and Youth Violence Prevention.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **C. EDUCATION**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan states, "We will build a system that is student-centered and easy-to-navigate. We'll prioritize equity, innovation, and learning".1 "Stronger Schools, Stronger Boston: A Plan to Foster Equity, Coherence, and Inno\[vation\]" is identified as a corresponding plan.1 Furthermore, the "Generate Networks of Opportunity: Fairmount Corridor" initiative explicitly includes "coordinated investments in... education".2 Linking education investments directly to a geographical area like the Fairmount Corridor suggests a strategy of targeted interventions. This approach aims to improve educational outcomes as an integral part of broader community revitalization efforts, potentially involving capital improvements to school facilities, program enhancements, or new partnerships focused on schools within the corridor, including those in Dorchester.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* The education component of the "Generate Networks of Opportunity: Fairmount Corridor" initiative is directly relevant to schools and educational programs located within those parts of Dorchester.  
* City-wide efforts to prioritize equity in the education system would apply to schools throughout Dorchester.  
* This initiative directly addresses thematic priorities such as Youth Engagement and Educational Programs.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **D. ECONOMY**

City-Wide Goal:  
The economic goals are to "give pathways to quality careers. We want to strengthen wealth-building policies. Our goal is to encourage job growth and support our small businesses".1 Corresponding plans include the "City of Boston Small Business Plan" and the "Economic Inclusion and Equity Agenda".1 This dual focus on "pathways to quality careers" and "support our small businesses" addresses economic development from both workforce development and entrepreneurship perspectives. For a neighborhood like Dorchester, this could mean connecting residents to job training programs aligned with growing economic sectors while simultaneously providing resources to help local businesses thrive and generate local employment opportunities.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Support for small businesses is highly pertinent to Dorchester, which is home to numerous local enterprises.  
* Initiatives designed to create "pathways to quality careers" and implement "wealth-building policies" are intended to benefit Dorchester residents.  
* Job growth stimulated by the "Expand Neighborhoods" action area, particularly in transit-accessible parts of Dorchester, would align with this economic initiative.  
* This initiative covers thematic priorities such as Economic Opportunity and Local Business Support.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **E. ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan indicates that "Boston is taking a combined approach to addressing climate change".1 Specifically, "The Energy and Environment initiative... outlines strategies to help the city reduce greenhouse gas emissions and become carbon neutral".4 "Climate Ready Boston" is listed as a corresponding plan, signaling alignment with its objectives to address climate change challenges through bold and creative actions.1 The "combined approach" and strategies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality suggest that environmental considerations will be integrated into diverse aspects of city planning. This integration would affect Dorchester through building codes, transportation investments, and land use decisions.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Climate resilience measures, especially for the coastal areas of Dorchester (which also relates to the "Create a Waterfront for Future Generations" action area), would be a key focus.  
* City-wide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—such as promoting public transit options like the Fairmount Line and improving energy efficiency in buildings—would apply to Dorchester.  
* Thematically, this initiative links to Public Safety (addressing climate-related hazards), Transportation (promoting sustainable options), and Housing (encouraging energy efficiency).

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **F. OPEN SPACE**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan includes dedicated initiatives for "Open space".1 A specific objective mentioned within the broader "INITIATIVES" section is "strengthening Franklin Park".2 The explicit naming of "strengthening Franklin Park" as a distinct initiative elevates this particular open space to a priority level within the plan. This suggests a commitment to significant investment and focused attention on a major regional park that serves Dorchester among other neighborhoods, potentially leading to improved amenities, programming, and ecological health for this vital green space.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Franklin Park is partially situated within Dorchester, making its strengthening a direct benefit to the neighborhood's residents.  
* General open space initiatives outlined in the plan would apply to various parks and recreational areas throughout Dorchester.  
* The "Create a Waterfront for Future Generations" action area also involves the creation of accessible open spaces along Dorchester's coastline.  
* This initiative directly addresses thematic priorities such as Parks, Open Spaces, and Community Centers.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **G. TRANSPORTATION**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan incorporates initiatives for "Transportation" 1, with "Go Boston 2030" cited as a corresponding plan whose mobility goals are integrated.1 A key highlighted initiative is "improving connections, frequency and experience on the Fairmount/Indigo Line".2 This reflects the vision shared by residents who "envisioned a city where... there are convenient, safe, and reliable options for getting around".2 The recurring and specific mention of the Fairmount Line improvement underscores its strategic importance. This focus is likely tied to the "Generate Networks of Opportunity: Fairmount Corridor" action area, aiming to enhance accessibility and catalyze development in the communities served by the line, including Dorchester.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Improvements to the Fairmount/Indigo Line represent a direct and major investment in Dorchester's transportation infrastructure.  
* General goals for "convenient, safe, and reliable options" for transportation would apply to streets, pedestrian infrastructure (such as street lighting and sidewalks), and other transit services operating within Dorchester.  
* This initiative covers thematic priorities like Transportation and Infrastructure, including the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line, street lighting, road improvements, and pedestrian safety.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan. However, the proximity of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle to the Fairmount Line means that improvements to the line directly benefit the transit access for TNT residents.

### **H. TECHNOLOGY**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan includes initiatives for "Technology" 1, recognizing that "Technology is changing how we work, live, and get around".2 A stated aim is to prepare the city for "advances in technology".3 The acknowledgment of technology's transformative role suggests a forward-looking approach. While specific programs under this initiative are not detailed in the available excerpts, its inclusion as a distinct category implies a commitment to leveraging technological advancements for city-wide improvement. For neighborhoods like Dorchester, this could translate into future projects related to ensuring digital equity, expanding public Wi-Fi access, or implementing tech-enabled city services.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* City-wide technology initiatives, such as those aimed at expanding broadband access or developing smart city applications, would be intended to benefit Dorchester residents and businesses.  
* No specific Dorchester-focused technology projects are detailed in the provided plan summaries.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **I. ARTS & CULTURE**

City-Wide Goal:  
The plan states, "We strive to create a vibrant public art realm. We encourage Arts Innovation Districts, support existing artists, and attract new artists".1 "The first cultural planning process for the City of Boston" is referenced as a related effort.1 This aligns with the vision of residents who imagined "neighborhoods with vibrant open spaces and cultural life".2 The focus on "Arts Innovation Districts" and supporting existing artists could provide opportunities for Dorchester's cultural organizations and local artists. The plan's goals are not solely focused on large institutions but also on enhancing the "public art realm" and fostering "cultural life" within neighborhoods, suggesting a decentralized approach that could benefit local cultural expressions throughout the city, including Dorchester.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Efforts to support artists and create a vibrant public art realm could lead to various projects or investments in Dorchester's cultural scene.  
* The goal of fostering "neighborhoods with vibrant... cultural life" applies directly to Dorchester.  
* An example of arts engagement activity during the planning period is cited: "The Mayor's Mural Crew painted a mural along Blue Hill Avenue on August 18, 2016" 2; Blue Hill Avenue runs through parts of Dorchester.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.

### **J. LAND USE AND PLANNING**

City-Wide Goal:  
A foundational principle of this initiative is that "Land can be used to guide growth and meet citywide policy goals".1 It also encompasses "The Boston Planning and Development Agency's efforts to serve the public in a transparent manner. Reforms and Organizational Strategy" 1, and "PLAN Initiatives. Creating long-term visions for places and communities across Boston".1 This initiative is critical, as land use planning and zoning are the primary regulatory mechanisms for implementing many of the other goals articulated in "Imagine Boston 2030," such as achieving desired housing densities, creating mixed-use areas, and preserving open space. The reference to "PLAN Initiatives" indicates that more detailed, localized planning processes are a key component of the overall strategy, translating broad city-wide aspirations into tangible changes at the neighborhood level.  
**Relevance to Dorchester:**

* Any specific neighborhood planning initiatives undertaken in Dorchester (for example, a "PLAN: Dorchester" process, if one exists or is initiated in the future) would fall under this category.  
* Zoning changes or land use policies designed to achieve objectives related to affordable housing, mixed-use development, or open space preservation would be implemented in Dorchester through the mechanisms of this initiative.

Specific Mention of Talbot-Norfolk Triangle:  
No specific mention of the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle was found for this initiative in the provided excerpts of the Imagine Boston 2030 plan.
